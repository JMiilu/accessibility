Testing accessibility of HTML with different tools.

Reports will be written inside _reports/_ directory.

Tools used:

- Puppeteer (https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer)
- Axe (axe-puppeteer) (https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-puppeteer)
- Pa11y (https://github.com/pa11y/pa11y)
- A11y (https://github.com/addyosmani/a11y)

Usage:

```
npm install
npm test
```

**Axe** and **Pa11y** seem to be most promising...
